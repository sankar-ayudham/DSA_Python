# DSA Python – Daily Practice 🚀

This repository is created for **daily practice of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** using **Python**.

The main purpose of this repository is to build **consistency in learning**, improve problem-solving skills, and maintain **regular GitHub activity** through daily practice.

---

## 🎯 Motive

The motive behind creating this repository is:

- Daily practice of Data Structures and Algorithms  
- Learning step by step without rushing  
- Strengthening fundamentals through repetition  
- Tracking long-term learning progress  
- Maintaining discipline using daily GitHub commits  

👉 Commits are **not limited to one problem per day**.

On some days there may be:
- 1 commit  
- 2–4 commits  
- Or multiple practice updates  

The focus is **daily learning**, not the number of problems or commits.

---

## 📁 Repository Structure

The code is organized topic-wise for clarity:

```
DSA_Python/
│
├── arrays/
├── LinkedList/
├── Stack/
├── queue/
├── recursion/
├── binary Tree/
├── avl Tree/
├── Dictionaries/
├── Tuple/
├── list/

```

Each folder contains Python programs related to that data structure or concept.

---

## 🧠 Practice Methodology

- Daily hands-on coding practice  
- Topic-wise learning  
- Simple and readable Python code  
- Focus on understanding logic rather than memorization  
- Rewriting and improving older code when required  

Some commits may include:
- New problems  
- Concept practice  
- Code improvement  
- Optimization  
- Revisions  

---

## 🗓️ Commit Philosophy

- Consistency over perfection  
- Learning over speed  
- Improvement over comparison  

Commit examples:

```
DSA(Array): practice problems
DSA(Tree): traversal concepts
DSA(Stack): implementation revision
DSA(DP): learning and practice
```

Every commit represents **learning activity**, not completion.

---

## 🧩 Topics Covered

- Arrays & Strings  
- Linked Lists  
- Stack & Queue  
- Recursion & Backtracking  
- Trees (Binary Tree, AVL Tree)  
- Searching & Sorting  
- Dynamic Programming  
- LeetCode practice problems  

More topics will be added as learning continues.

---

## 🚀 Long-Term Goal

- Build strong DSA foundations  
- Improve analytical thinking  
- Prepare for technical interviews  
- Maintain a consistent learning routine  
- Create a transparent learning timeline on GitHub  

---

## 📌 Note

This repository is maintained purely for **learning and practice purposes**.

Code quality and optimization will continuously improve as concepts become clearer with time.

---

## ⭐ Final Thought

Consistency matters more than intensity.

Even small daily practice leads to strong results over time.
